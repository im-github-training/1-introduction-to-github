## Welcome

Welcome to the InfoMagnus GitHub Training Platform

This repository is part of the [InfoMagnus GitHub Training Guide](https://im-github-training.github.io/).

<!-- Write an introductory paragraph for this turtorial -->

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of Git and GitHub by working through a series of exercises.  We'll start with the basics of creating a repository, working with branches, and making commits.  From there, we'll cover more advanced topics such as merging, rebasing, and pull requests.

### Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need a basic understanding of the terminal (or command line).  If you're new to the terminal, we recommend checking out [Codecademy's Command Line Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).

You'll also need to have Git installed on your machine and a GitHub account.  If you need help with this, please see:
